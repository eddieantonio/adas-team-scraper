How to do the thing
-------------------

### Install system requirements

 - `make`: you probably have this already
 - `pipenv`:  you might have this. Install it like this if you don't: `brew install pipenv`
 - Python 3.7: `pipenv` will probably install this?

Next, install all the things with `pipenv`:

```sh
pipenv install
```

### Running

Activate the `pipenv` environment:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

Within the environment, type `make`!

```sh
make -j 8
```

(`-j 8`  starts up to 8 jobs simultaneously; adjust it as you see fit).

If all went well, you should now have Markdown posts, ready for
publication in `_posts/`!


It all didn't go well
---------------------

Oh, that's a bummer! Send me an issue report!


How does it work?
-----------------

Very carefully.
